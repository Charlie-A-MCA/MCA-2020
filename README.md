## Week 1 

### Task 2: Dataset Theme 

I have chosen to use the hard rock band Linkin Park as the theme of my dataset due to them being one of my favourite bands meaning I know their music well and feel I will enjoy exploring their music further. 

Linkin Park started out in 1996 in California, following the nu metal path, releasing their debut album ‘Hybrid Theory’ in 2000. The band has 6 members, though Chester \(Lead Vocalist\) passed away in 2017, leaving the band at 5 members currently. The remaining members are:
*	Mike Shinoda – Vocalist/Rhythm Guitar
*	Brad Delson – Lead Guitar 
* Dave Farrell \(aka Phoenix\) – Bassist
*	Joe Hahn – DJ/Mixer
*	Rob Bourdon – Drums 

They are currently on Hiatus following Chester’s passing. Their most recent album ‘One more light’ was released in 2017, three years after their previous album. Linkin park has a mix of original, remix and live albums which total at 11 currently. To date they have sold over 100 million records worldwide, have been nominated for 6 Grammys, numerous other awards and have notably won the ‘Best Hard Rock Performance’ Grammy in 2002 for their performance of ‘Crawling’ from their debut album. 


### Task 3: Current manifestations of data relating to dataset 


**Descriptive Data**

Descriptive data is very limited on the bands website currently as it requires you to click through to a streaming service/YouTube or to look on their store for any information. The store only shows a few recent albums and only displays the Album name and track lists. The streaming services supply further descriptive data such as the length of each track, release date, running time, style of music and album artwork. It is also possible to select pre-created playlists, search using lyrics and have other bands suggested based on further descriptive data stored in the background. 

Further searching online revealed that further information can be found on other sites that have complied the data. The Linkin Park Association offers a wide range of descriptive data, starting with a description of albums, including notable facts such as awards won. It also shows when the album was released, length of the album, audio formats available \(e.g. CD or Vinyl\), the mixer and producers, the record label and provides a track list. This track list details if the song was released as a single, has a video or tabs available and also offers a link to the lyrics. 

Another site is Allmusic which provides many of the same elements as Linkin Park Association, but also includes musical styles of each album, recording location and is able to suggest similar albums from other artists based on this data. 


**Notated Data**

In terms of notated data, it is possible to find sheet music for most of Linkin Parks songs, with the more popular songs being easiest to locate. The sheet music is possible to find for a range of instruments/vocal arrangements, along with some fan created remixes/tribute pieces. Many of the online catalogues of sheet music include Linkin Park with musicnotes.com, 8notes.com and musescore.com being notable sources. Musescore.com is fan created sheet music but is useful as it can be filtered down by artist, song, instrument type, tempo etc. making it easier to find exactly what is required. 


**Acoutsic Data**

It is possible to find acoustic data on YouTube under the bands official channel, along with recordings of live performance, fan made videos of tributes or covers and lyric videos also possible to access. 

Linkin Park’s official website offers links to streaming services that provide their music. These include Apple music, Spotify, Amazon Music and Tidal. Additionally, some content is posted on the band’s social media pages which includes acoustic aspects.
